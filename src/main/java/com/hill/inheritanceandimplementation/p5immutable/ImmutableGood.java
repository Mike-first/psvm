//How to create Immutable class in Java?
//https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-immutable-class-java/
//The class must be declared as final so that child classes can’t be created (see Mutable extends ImmutableBad)
//Data members in the class must be declared private so that direct access is not allowed.
//Data members in the class must be declared as final so that we can’t change the value of it after object creation.
//A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields performing a deep copy so that data members can’t be modified with an object reference.
//Deep Copy of objects should be performed in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference)
//In Java, all the wrapper classes (like Integer, Boolean, Byte, Short) and String class is immutable.

public final class ImmutableGood {
    private final int a;

    public ImmutableGood(int a) {
        this.a = a;
    }

    public int getA() {
        return a;
    }
}
